Instructions:
1) Code should run on any operating system with python 3 installed, however it was extensively tested on windows.
2) Make sure all files are extracted at the same location.
3) Run the 'main.py' file. This file further executes 'makecode.py' file and 'ShortestPath.py' file.
4) The program will check for and install all required libraries on its own.
5) No further instructions are needed to run the code. The program will prompt and give instructions during the execution.

Bugs:
1) In creative mode if a maze with no solution is attempted to be visualized, it takes quite a bit of time for the error message to show up on the screen.

Final Word:
This was our first attempt at creating a GUI using python and so the effort maybe lacking in more ways than one. Even so, making this game was a great learning experience for each of us involved and we look forward to making more advanced projects in the future.
